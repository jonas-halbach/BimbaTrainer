# BimbaTrainer
A simple Android-App to help training Capoeira sequences
## Introduction
In capoeira the training is often structured in sequences. This means two partners execute a sequence of movements
where the movement of one person is a reaction to the previous movement of the trainings partner.
This kind of training was introduced by Mestre Bimba, who is a very popular capoeirista. He also invented the sequences
of [Mestre Bimba which is a series of 8 sequences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7l44vIrLgE) which are trained in 
numerous capoeira groups. The sequences are numbered from 1 - 8 which are normally trained in this order.
There are also other popular sequences by other mestres. One other popular sequence is the Miudinho sequence.

## What is this app for?
This app supports in the training of these sequences, by telling you what sequence you (and your partner) shall execute 
next.<br/>
It may be that you want to train the sequences in a different order and with or without a partner.<br/>
There are different settings which you can modify to specify how you want to train:
- If you want to train alone or with a partner select 1 or 2 player
- If you want to train the Bimba, Miudinho sequences or both you should select Bimba, Miudinho or All
- Select ascending, descending or random if you want to train the sequences in a ascending, descending or random order. 
<br/>

The scrollbar can be used to select the timeframe which is available for the execution of one sequence.
Clicking the "Start" button starts the training.

## The Training
Depending on your settings during the training you will hear:
1. "Bimba" or "Miudinho" or Nothing if you selected you just want to train a single type of these both sequences. 
This tells you the type of sequence you (and your partner) shall execute. 
2. A number which tells you which of the sequences to execute.
3. "A", "B" or nothing depending if you are training alone or with a partner. This letter tells you if you shall execute 
the A or B part of the sequence
